## How to use

### Static version

1. Make Svelte page
2. Include `import { Fullpage, FullpageSection, FullpageSlide } from 'svelte-fullpage';` into mentioned file.
3. Make fullpage sections and put them into `<Fullpage>`, if you need slides, make them too and put them into some `<FullpageSection>`.
4. Define new arrays that will contain all names of all sections and slides, insert them into Fullpage or FullpageSection
component, example `<Fullpage sections={myFullpageSectionsNames}` or `<FullpageSlide slides={myFullpageSlidesNames}`.
5. You can check if everything is working, if you use Sapper, don't forget to make this component SSR, just include
it like this `import Fullpage from 'svelte-fullpage/src/Fullpage.svelte'` and section as well 
`import FullpageSection from 'svelte-fullpage/src/FullpageSection.svelte'` also slides 
`import FullpageSlide from 'svelte-fullpage/src/FullpageSlide.svelte'`.

NOTE - Fullpage component is positioned **absolute**, it is recommended to put it into element with position **relative**.
